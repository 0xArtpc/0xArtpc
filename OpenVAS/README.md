## OpenVAS installation from source
<p>I made this to automate the process of installation, it can be time consuming.</p>

### How to use it
<p>To run use a user that isn't root, change the permissions to be executable using
```bash
chmod +x installation-script.sh
``` 
Execute the script using 
```bash
./installation-script.sh
```
````python
print 'bar'
  ````
