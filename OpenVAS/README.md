## OpenVAS installation from source
<p>I made this to automate the process of installation, it can be time consuming.</p>

### How to use it
<p>To run use a user that isn't root, change the permissions to be executable using</p>
`chmod +x installation-script.sh`
Execute the script using 
`./installation-script.sh`

### Update Greenbone OpenVAS
<p>To update to Newer Releases run the script update.sh, first change to executable permissions using</p>
`chmod +x update.sh`
Execute the script using
`./update.sh`
